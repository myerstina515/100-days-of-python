# Tina Myers 100 days of Python

## Goal

My goal in completing 100 days of Python is to expand my knowledge of coding and begin learning more about Data/ML/AI to continue to gain skills. Data has always been intriguing to me, and I enjoy statistics. AI/ML are two things I haven't known about for long, but I'm excited to see if I can learn more about it all!

I will list each day here in the README, what was worked on for class that day, and the link to the work I did for the day, easily accessible in one place. The 100 days of Python is via a Udemy course by Dr. Angela Yu and is located [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) on Udemy.

## 100 Days Starts Here

### Day 1: Band Name Generator

Worked with variables, inputs, and the print command, which at the moment feels much less complicated than JavaScript (my primary language). I was able to complete all of the tests on the first attempt for each code challenge, and the final project for the day resides [here](https://replit.com/@TinaFielder/band-name-generator-start?v=1) in a repl. I'm excited to learn about coding in VS Code for Python and to get small projects into a repo.

### Day 2: Tip Calculator

Worked on Data Types and mathematical operators, specifically int, float, round, and reviewed PEDMAS. At the end of the day, I built a tip calculator on repl that resides [here](https://replit.com/@TinaFielder/tip-calculator-start?v=1). This was a fun project, though I feel as though I complete it faster than is intended because of already knowing one language. Some of the information is review, but I'm still learning things (such as `/+` and `*=` working, not just addition/subtraction as I thought before). F strings are also interesting, they compare to object literal notation in JS, also much simpler than object literal notation. I'm enjoying Python so far!

### Day 3: Choose Your Adventure Game

This was a fun one, working on `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements, conditional within conditional statements, `.lower()`, `.count()`, and finding that `not` in Python is similar to `!` or `bang` in JavaScript. It definitely helps me to consider the JavaScript equivalent when learning new things in Python. The code challenges today included a leap year predictor, calculating a pizza order bill, and making conditional statements within our BMI calculator we worked on day 2. Today's final project was a choose your own adventure game, which lives [here](https://replit.com/@TinaFielder/treasure-island-start?v=1), and she even went over using ASCII images, which was helpful. Another fun day! I do feel like the "challenging" tasks are more challenging if you were completely new to code, which I'm not, so the little challenges don't take very long. I'm looking forward to increased complexity as the course continues on.
