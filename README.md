# Tina Myers 100 days of Python

The front end of this project lives on Netlify and can be found by clicking [here](https://tinamyers-python.netlify.app)

## Goal

My goal in completing 100 days of Python is to expand my knowledge of coding and begin learning more about Data/ML/AI to continue to gain skills. Data has always been intriguing to me, and I enjoy statistics. AI/ML are two things I haven't known about for long, but I'm excited to see if I can learn more about it all!

I will list each day here in the README, what was worked on for class that day, and the link to the work I did for the day, easily accessible in one place. The 100 days of Python is via a Udemy course by Dr. Angela Yu and is located [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) on Udemy.

## 100 Days Starts Here

### Day 1: Band Name Generator

Worked with variables, inputs, and the print command, which at the moment feels much less complicated than JavaScript (my primary language). I was able to complete all of the tests on the first attempt for each code challenge, and the final project for the day resides [here](https://replit.com/@TinaFielder/band-name-generator-start?v=1) in a repl. I'm excited to learn about coding in VS Code for Python and to get small projects into a repo.

### Day 2: Tip Calculator

Worked on Data Types and mathematical operators, specifically int, float, round, and reviewed PEDMAS. At the end of the day, I built a tip calculator on repl that resides [here](https://replit.com/@TinaFielder/tip-calculator-start?v=1). This was a fun project, though I feel as though I complete it faster than is intended because of already knowing one language. Some of the information is review, but I'm still learning things (such as `/+` and `*=` working, not just addition/subtraction as I thought before). F strings are also interesting, they compare to object literal notation in JS, also much simpler than object literal notation. I'm enjoying Python so far!

### Day 3: Choose Your Adventure Game

This was a fun one, working on `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements, conditional within conditional statements, `.lower()`, `.count()`, and finding that `not` in Python is similar to `!` or `bang` in JavaScript. It definitely helps me to consider the JavaScript equivalent when learning new things in Python. The code challenges today included a leap year predictor, calculating a pizza order bill, and making conditional statements within our BMI calculator we worked on day 2. Today's final project was a choose your own adventure game, which lives [here](https://replit.com/@TinaFielder/treasure-island-start?v=1), and she even went over using ASCII images, which was helpful. Another fun day! I do feel like the "challenging" tasks are more challenging if you were completely new to code, which I'm not, so the little challenges don't take very long. I'm looking forward to increased complexity as the course continues on.

### Day 4: Rock, Paper, Scissors

This was fun, it worked with randomization. I wanted to go back and make it into "Rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock" (for my fellow nerds out there), but will have to go back at some point to complete this, I didn't have access to the rules of the game, nor could I find good ASCII figures for lizard and spock. One day. In the meantime, it was really fun to integrate the ASCII images again, I think I might want to integrate these more in the future.

### Day 5: Password Generator

Not only did we go over the FizzBuzz interview question in this module, the password generator was interesting. Not only did it grab random numbers, letters, and uppercase numbers, but it randomized the result before generating the password. Grabbing a random letter and number from libraries was an interesting twist, and there were lots of loops in this one.

### Day 6: Functions on Karel

Today was fun! This introduced functions in Python, but it utilized the game interface, Karel. The guy had to make it over all the hurdles regardless of how many there were, how high they were, and how quickly the next one occurred. It was a good test to my previous knowledge of JavaScript and the function syntax was an interesting change.

### Day 7: Hangman

For day 7, it was fun to import a random dictionary to pick a word for the hangman game to utilize. This one focues much more on piecing out a complex problem and figuring out how to break it into smaller steps that are more easily solved. This one took a little bit longer, but was worth it so I could have a deeper understanding of solving problems in Python.

### Day 8: Caesar Cipher

Caesar ciphers are so stinking much fun. I loved this one, between all the encryption and decryption, keeping things organized... so fun. This cipher shifts the letters by an amount the user chooses, and it returns the encoded message. If the user choosed "decode", they enter the encoded message and returns the decoded message.

### Day 9: Blind Auction

Blind auction was fun! I love that things are getting a little bit more challenging. This app creates a highest bidder function, and each time a person enters a bid, they state if there are other bids. If there are, it clears the screen so as to keep the bids secret, and stores all the bids until there are no additional bids to be made. When bidding is complete, the program prints who the highest bidder was and their bid.

### Day 10: Calculator

Calculators, for some inexplicable reason, have always seemed complicated to me, however this was a relatively simple activity. It created a calculator by adding while loops, recursion, and functions. Not complicated as I expected. It also seems like a slightly boring app, I'm not sure how many calculators are getting folks jobs out there. 

### Day 11: Blackjack

So, I haven't fully started this lesson yet, but I anticipate it NOT being as complex as the Blackjack API I made in bootcamp. We spent a week making a fully functional API that makes calls, stores player data and bank information. But let's see:
