# Tina Myers 100 days of Python

## Goal

My goal in completing 100 days of Python is to expand my knowledge of coding and begin learning more about Data/ML/AI to continue to gain skills. Data has always been intriguing to me, and I enjoy statistics. AI/ML are two things I haven't known about for long, but I'm excited to see if I can learn more about it all!

I will list each day here in the README, what was worked on for class that day, and the link to the work I did for the day, easily accessible in one place. The 100 days of Python is via a Udemy course by Dr. Angela Yu and is located [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) on Udemy.

## 100 Days Starts Here

### Day 1: Band Name Generator

Worked with variables, inputs, and the print command, which at the moment feels much less complicated than JavaScript (my primary language). I was able to complete all of the tests on the first attempt for each code challenge, and the final project for the day resides [here](https://replit.com/@TinaFielder/band-name-generator-start#main.py) in a repl. I'm excited to learn about coding in VS Code for Python and to get small projects into a repo.

### Day 2: Tip Calculator

Worked on Data Types and mathematical operators, specifically int, float, round, and reviewed PEDMAS. At the end of the day, I built a tip calculator on repl that resides [here](https://replit.com/@TinaFielder/tip-calculator-start#main.py). This was a fun project, though I feel as though I complete it faster than is intended because of already knowing one language. Some of the information is review, but I'm still learning things (such as `/+` and `*=` working, not just addition/subtraction as I thought before). F strings are also interesting, they compare to object literal notation in JS, also much simpler than object literal notation. I'm enjoying Python so far!
